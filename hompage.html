    <h2>A Haven of Hope for Every Paw and Heartbeat</h2>
    <p>
      At Soul Shelter, we believe every animal deserves a second chance, a safe space where healing begins and love never ends.
      Our shelter is more than just a refuge; it’s a soulful sanctuary where abandoned, abused, and homeless animals find care, compassion,
      and a path to their forever homes. Whether you’re here to adopt, volunteer, donate, or simply learn more, we welcome you into our growing
      family of animal lovers. Together, we can make a difference. One rescue, one wagging tail, and one happy soul at a time.

      <h3>1. From Stray to Star: Pudding’s Miracle Journey</h3>

      <p>
        Pudding, a senior Labrador mix, was found wandering the streets with a limp and cloudy eyes. Many would have overlooked him,
        but not us, and certainly not the Li family. After weeks of medical care, Pudding met the Lis at an adoption event, and it was love at first sight.
        Now he spends his days lounging on the couch and playing fetch with his new siblings. His story reminds us: every soul matters,
        no matter their age or past.
